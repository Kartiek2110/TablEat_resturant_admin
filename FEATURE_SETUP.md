# ðŸš€ New Features Setup Guide

## Overview
Your TablEat restaurant admin now includes three major new features:

1. **Inventory Management** (Premium + Approval Required)
2. **Staff Management** (Approval Required) 
3. **Enhanced Analytics with Date Filtering** (Always Available)

## Database Setup Required

To enable the new features, you need to add approval flags to your restaurant document in Firebase Firestore.

### 1. Navigate to Firebase Console
- Go to your Firebase project
- Open Firestore Database
- Navigate to `restaurants` > `BY_THE_WAY` (your restaurant document)

### 2. Add Approval Fields
Click "Edit" on your restaurant document and add these fields:

```json
{
  "inventory_management_approved": true,
  "staff_management_approved": true
}
```

### 3. Current Restaurant Document Structure
Your document should now look like this:

```json
{
  "adminEmail": "by_the_way_admin@gmail.com",
  "createdAt": "14 June 2025 at 16:11:14 UTC+5:30",
  "name": "BY_THE_WAY",
  "staff_management_code": "1234",
  "status": "active",
  "subscriptionEnd": "15 July 2025 at 21:31:56 UTC+5:30", 
  "subscriptionStatus": "active",
  "updatedAt": "15 June 2025 at 21:31:56 UTC+5:30",
  "inventory_management_approved": true,
  "staff_management_approved": true
}
```

## Feature Access Logic

### Inventory Management
- âœ… **Premium subscription** (your restaurant is already premium)
- âœ… **inventory_management_approved = true**
- Both conditions must be met to access inventory features

### Staff Management  
- âœ… **staff_management_approved = true**
- âœ… **Valid staff_management_code** (you already have "1234")
- Both conditions must be met to access staff features

### Enhanced Analytics
- âœ… **Always available** - no approval needed
- Date filtering and menu item filtering work immediately

## New Collections Created

The features will create these new collections in Firestore:

```
restaurants/BY_THE_WAY/
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory/              # Inventory items
â”œâ”€â”€ stock_transactions/     # Inventory usage history  
â”œâ”€â”€ staff/                  # Staff member records
â””â”€â”€ attendance/             # Daily attendance records
```

## Testing the Features

1. **Menu Management** - Should work immediately (no approval needed)
2. **Inventory Management** - Add approval flag, then access via sidebar
3. **Staff Management** - Add approval flag, then enter code "1234"
4. **Analytics** - Use date filters immediately

## Firestore Rules Updated

The Firestore rules have been updated to:
- âœ… Allow menu management (always works)
- âœ… Allow new collections for authenticated users
- âœ… Maintain security for customer-facing features
- âœ… Enable public access for orders and menu viewing

## Quick Setup Commands

If you prefer to set this up via code, you can run this in your browser console on the Firebase Firestore page:

```javascript
// This is just for reference - use the UI to add the fields
{
  "inventory_management_approved": true,
  "staff_management_approved": true
}
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that both approval flags are set to `true`
2. Verify your staff management code is "1234"  
3. Ensure you're logged in as the admin
4. Check browser console for any permission errors

Happy managing! ðŸŽ‰
